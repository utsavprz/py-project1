1.Write a program that takes three numbers and prints their sum. Every number is given on a separate line.

2.Write a program that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle and prints the area. Every number is given on a separate line.

3.N students take K apples and distribute them among each other evenly. The remaining (the  undivisible)  part  remains  in  the  basket.  How  many  apples  will  each  single  student get? How many apples will remain in the basket? The program reads the numbers Nand K. It should print the two answers for the questions above.

4.Given the integer N -the number of minutes that is passed since midnight -how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?The program should print two numbers: the numberof hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).For example, if N = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight -i.e. now is 2:30 am. So,the program should print 2 30.
